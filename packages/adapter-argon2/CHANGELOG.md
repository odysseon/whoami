# @odysseon/whoami-adapter-argon2

## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

- 7facf91: Ship the feature-first core API for accounts, authentication, and receipts, add feature-layer tests, and include an Express example app that consumes the public core exports.

  Remove the legacy facade and interface surface from `@odysseon/whoami-core`, and migrate all first-party adapters to the new contracts:
  - `@odysseon/whoami-adapter-argon2` now implements `PasswordHasher`
  - `@odysseon/whoami-adapter-jose` now provides receipt signing and verification
  - `@odysseon/whoami-adapter-webcrypto` now implements `DeterministicStringHasher`
  - `@odysseon/whoami-adapter-nestjs` now centers on receipt verification, route protection, and domain error translation
